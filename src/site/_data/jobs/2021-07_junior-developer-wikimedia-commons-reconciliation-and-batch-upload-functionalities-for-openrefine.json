  "title": "Junior Developer - Wikimedia Commons reconciliation and batch upload functionalities for OpenRefine",
  "body": "[OpenRefine](https://openrefine.org/) is a power tool to clean messy data, popular in a diverse range of communities. It has been serving the needs of journalists, librarians, Wikipedians, scientists for more than 10 years, and is taught in many curricula and workshops around the world. \n\nOpenRefine is quite actively used on [Wikidata](https://www.wikidata.org), the structured data ‘sister’ of Wikipedia. In addition, thanks to a [grant from the Wikimedia Foundation](https://meta.wikimedia.org/wiki/Grants:Project/Structured_Data_on_Wikimedia_Commons_functionalities_in_OpenRefine), OpenRefine will, between September 2021 and August 2022, be extended with structured data functionalities for [Wikimedia Commons](https://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/Commons:Structured_data), the media repository of the Wikimedia ecosystem. This code extension will make it possible to batch edit structured data of existing files on Wikimedia Commons, and to batch upload new Wikimedia Commons files with structured data from the start.\n\nThe OpenRefine team is seeking a junior developer who will build the Wikimedia-specific features, as web services hosted on [Wikimedia Toolforge](https://wikitech.wikimedia.org/wiki/Portal:Toolforge) or [Wikimedia Cloud VPS](https://wikitech.wikimedia.org/wiki/Portal:Cloud_VPS) for the abovementioned functionalities. \n\n* Part time contract, over a period of 6 months.\n* Active work will be around 20 weeks, roughly from September 2021 until end February 2022.\n* For an average of 20 hours per week.\n* Fully remote.

Depending on circumstances, this batch upload functionality will be developed to be compatible with already existing upload tools in the Wikimedia ecosystems, such as QuickStatements, or as a new tool.\n* Works in close collaboration with their colleague (OpenRefine developer), and will regularly coordinate with the product manager and the rest of the OpenRefine development team.\n\nYou can read more about this project, the planned tasks and the various roles, in the [public grant proposal](https://meta.wikimedia.org/wiki/Grants:Project/Structured_Data_on_Wikimedia_Commons_functionalities_in_OpenRefine) on meta.wikimedia.org.\n\n## Qualifications\n\nPlease do not self-censor if you do not meet all of these criteria, as you will have to develop your skills during the project.\n\n* Experience developing web services in a language of your choice.\n* Enthusiasm for writing good documentation and tests alongside your code.\n* Ability to work independently in a fully remote project.\n* Experience with open source development workflows on GitHub.\n* Familiarity with tool deployment on the Wikimedia Toolforge.\n* Familiarity or experience with datasets in non-Western languages, non-Latin scripts, right to left writing systems, non-Western calendars, etc. is a plus.\n\n## How to Apply\n\nPlease send your resume or CV, sample of your relevant previous work, and a short letter of interest to advisory.committee@openrefine.org. We will schedule an interview with short-listed candidates.
