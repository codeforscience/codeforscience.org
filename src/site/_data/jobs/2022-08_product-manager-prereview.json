We envision a future in which every researcher is empowered with the skills to recognize and fight bias, and is welcomed into an open peer review culture where clear, constructive, actionable feedback is expected and rewarded. \n\nTowards this vision, we design and develop open-source infrastructure to enable anyone to provide constructive feedback to preprints, we design and facilitate peer review mentoring and training programs, and we partner with like-minded organizations to create opportunities for researchers to establish meaningful collaborations and connections defeating cultural and geographical barriers.\n\nThe current PREreview platform is a free and open-source website for the crowdsourcing of preprint reviews. It is a place where community members find a welcoming, resourceful space to compose, read, endorse and comment on preprint reviews. \n\n[PREreview](https://prereview.org) is a project fiscally sponsored by the US-based non-profit organization [Code for Science and Society (CS&S)](https://codeforsociety.org). We are primarily a grant-funded organization; however, we also receive support via key partners such as [eLife](https://elifesciences.org), as well as gain revenue via contracts and consulting opportunities. You can read more about our partnership with eLife [here](https://elifesciences.org/for-the-press/3071bfea/elife-and-prereview-partner-to-promote-greater-diversity-in-peer-review) and [here](https://elifesciences.org/for-the-press/a5f813bc/elife-and-prereview-extend-partnership-to-boost-community-engagement-in-open-peer-review).\n\nLearn more about us: [Mission and Vision](https://content.prereview.org/mission) | [Our Team](https://content.prereview.org/people) | [How we are funded](https://content.prereview.org/funding) | [Equity, Diversity, and Inclusion Statement](https://content.prereview.org/edi) | [Blog](https://content.prereview.org)\n\n### Working at PREreview\n\nYou will join a small, highly-collaborative, fully-remote team of passionate people dedicated to catalyzing culture and practice change in scholarly communication and evaluation.
